🔍 Key Findings
Ratings:

Most restaurants are rated between 3.5 and 4.2, reflecting a highly competitive food scene.
Extremely low ratings are rare, suggesting an overall decent dining standard.

Cost:

The majority of restaurants fall in the ₹0–₹2000 cost range for two.
Higher cost does not strongly guarantee a higher rating.

Location:

Certain areas have high restaurant density, indicating strong competition zones.
Some lower-density areas still show competitive average ratings, hinting at hidden gems.

Online Ordering:

Restaurants offering online ordering show slightly higher average ratings, possibly due to wider reach and customer convenience.

Table Booking:

Restaurants with table booking tend to have marginally higher ratings, suggesting a premium dining positioning.

Cuisine:

People largely enjoy nostalgic homestyle food — North and South Indian cuisines dominate.
However, with the rise of café culture, Italian, continental, and finger food options are gaining popularity among younger crowds.
